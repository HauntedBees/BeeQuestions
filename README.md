# Bee Questions
## wut
Bee Questions is an A&Q website. Post answers, get questions.
## license
Bee Questions is GPLv3 because yes.
## why
A friend of a friend suggested the idea as a joke on Facebook and I thought it was hilarious so I made it.
## also
Bee Questions ues my own [SQLManager](https://github.com/HauntedBees/SqlManager) and [HTMLFriend](https://github.com/HauntedBees/HTMLFriend) files, as well as the [Facebook PHP SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/php/gettingstarted) for handling user registration. Also on the client side it uses [bootstrap-notify](http://goodybag.github.io/bootstrap-notify/), [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) which are linked to in ```html\master.html```, but if those CDN links die or whatever then you'll probably have to find them yourself.
